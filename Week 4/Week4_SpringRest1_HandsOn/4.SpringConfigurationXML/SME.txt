EXPLANATIONS:

<bean> tag - Declares an object to be managed by Spring IoC container.

id attribute - Unique name used to retrieve the bean (context.getBean("country")).

class attribute - Fully‑qualified Java type to instantiate via reflection.

<property> tag - Performs setter injection after the bean’s constructor runs.

name attribute - Matches the Java setter (setCode, setName).

value attribute - Literal value assigned to the property.

ApplicationContext - Central IoC container interface (builds & wires beans, provides AOP, i18n, resource loading).

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext - Implementation that locates XML configs on the classpath and eagerly instantiates singleton beans.


What exactly happens when context.getBean() is invoked?
=> 1. Looks up bean definition by id.
   2. Creates instance if not already built(singleton scope).
   3. Performs Dependency injection(properties/constructor args).
   4. Executes BeanPostProcessors, lifecycle callbacks(@PostConstruct, init-method).
   5. Casts/returns fully initialized object.
