4. Analysis

Q. Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

Algorithm	Best Case	Average Case	Worst Case
Linear Search	   O(1)		    O(n)	   O(n)
Binary Search	   O(1)		  O(log n)	 O(log n)
where n is the number of searching elements.


Q. Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

=> Binary search is more suitable than linear search because it takes lesser time to search an element in the dataset.
