1.Understand Asymptotic Notation

Q. Explain Big O Notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
=> Big O Notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space as the input size increases. It helps in predicting scalability and performance bottlenecks.

Q. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
=> There are two types of search operations:
	1. Linear Search
	2. Binary Search
Linear Search: It checks for the entire dataset whether the dataset is sorted or unsorted. Slower for large datasets.

Binary Search: Requires a sorted dataset and checks only that part where it can have the element it is looking for.

Best Case: Occurs when the searching element is at the beginning.

Average Case: Occurs when the searching element is anywhere between the starting and the ending element in the dataset.

Worst Case: Occurs when the searching element is at the last of the dataset.
